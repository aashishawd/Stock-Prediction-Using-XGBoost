      <h1 class="w3-center">About XGBoost Algorithm</h1><br>
      <p class="w3-large">XGBoost is a scalable and highly accurate implementation of gradient boosting that pushes the limits of computing power for boosted tree algorithms, being built largely for energizing machine learning model performance and computational speed.</p>
      <p class="w3-large">XGBoost gained significant favor in the last few years as a result of helping individuals and teams win virtually every Kaggle structured data competition. In these competitions, companies and researchers post data after which statisticians and data miners compete to produce the best models for predicting and describing the data.

        Initially both Python and R implementations of XGBoost were built. Owing to its popularity, today XGBoost has package implementations for Java, Scala, Julia, Perl, and other languages. These implementations have opened the XGBoost library to even more developers and improved its appeal throughout the Kaggle community.
        
        XGBoost has been integrated with a wide variety of other tools and packages such as scikit-learn for Python enthusiasts and caret for R users. In addition, XGBoost is integrated with distributed processing frameworks like Apache Spark and Dask.</p>
